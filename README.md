Really basic stuff

This an experiment to see what my custom overrides look like without open source libraries.
It's meant to be ugly.
It's also meant to be kind of empty - as image placeholders have been removed.
At some point i'll but one in so this repo can demonstrate breakpoints - or not as it is a fairly straightforward concept with lots of basic examples.
