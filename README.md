Really basic stuff

This repo demonstrates breakpoints in menus. It's also an experiment to see what my custom overrides look like without open source libraries.
It's meant to be ugly.
It's also meant to be kind of empty - as image placeholders have been removed.

An implementation of this can be found at: www.thehomespungoods.com
